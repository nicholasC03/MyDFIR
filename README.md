## Projects

### SOC Investigation Practice (Defensive Security)

A collection of hands-on defensive security investigations focused on Tier 1 SOC responsibilities.  
Each project emphasizes **log analysis, alert triage, analyst reasoning, and escalation decisions** rather than tool output alone.

#### Investigation Areas
- Linux authentication log analysis (SSH, sudo, user activity)
- Network connection and process inspection
- Basic incident triage and severity assessment
- Detection logic and escalation criteria

#### Methodology Used
- Identify suspicious behavior from logs or system output
- Correlate events across multiple data points
- Determine impact and likelihood
- Document findings as a SOC analyst would

Currently expanding skills through hands-on labs, Linux command-line analysis, and defensive security exercises.  
Documenting practical takeaways with a focus on real-world SOC workflows.
